# Refcards

I wanted a half decent reference card with my keybindings from the lispy/lispyville package. 

This thing collects your current key bindings and let's you filter and or group the based on some predicate. 

Any nice looking refcard will have some manual labour involved, but I just wanted a easy way to export my current bindings so I could create some nice refcards

# Usage

- Get the bindings
- Filter
- Group them
- Them them to latex into any fil
- Open "reference.tex", and edit it to include your own bindings.
  You should also add newpages and maybe column breaks
- Render with pdflatex
- print!
